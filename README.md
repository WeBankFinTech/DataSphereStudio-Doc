## Introduce

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DataSphere Studio (DSS for short) is a one-stop data application development and management framework developed by WeBank.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under a unified UI, DataSphere Studio provides a workflow-based graphical drag-and-drop development experience, which will satisfy the requirements from data exchange, desensitization cleaning, analysis and mining, quality inspection, visual display, timing scheduling to Data output applications, etc., data application development full-process scenario requirements.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**DSS is designed with a pluggable integration framework, allowing users to easily and quickly replace various functional components that DSS has integrated, or add new functional components according to their needs. **
## Integrated application tools

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DSS has integrated a variety of upper-layer data application systems by implementing multiple AppConns, which can basically meet the data development needs of users.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**If desired, new data application systems can also be easily integrated to replace or enrich DSS's data application development process.** [Click me to learn how to quickly integrate new application systems](en_US/Development_Documentation/Third-party_System_Access_Development_Guide.md)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the high risk of script execution supported by DataSphere Studio, the isolation of the WeDataSphere Demo environment has not been completed. Considering that everyone is consulting the Demo environment, it is decided to first issue invitation codes to the community and accept trial applications from enterprises and organizations.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you want to try the Demo environment, please join the DataSphere Studio community user group [Join the group to jump](#1), and contact the team members to get the invitation code.
